# DOOMFLY: completed one-hour QA

Observed 5 September 2026, 20:46:41.934–21:46:42.232 UTC
(3:46–4:46 p.m. Central). The original fixed-connection baseline was not reset
or modified during this window. This report concerns that baseline, not the
separate learning candidate developed alongside it.

**Verdict: the recorded pixel→neuron→button implementation is traceable, but the
run does not validate fly vision, learning, survival skill, or a literal fly
brain. It is suitable to describe as an inspectable connectome-based BCI
experiment. A learning/survival announcement is not supported.**

## Coverage and technical checks

- 3,600.31 seconds of observation; 716 state snapshots, 110 saved images and
  22,050 consecutive per-tic audit events. One run ID; no audit-tic gaps.
- Approximately 630 seconds (10.5 minutes) of neural/game time at 0.175× wall
  speed. This was not an hour of simulated fly experience. Maximum snapshot
  gap was 17.66 seconds, although the per-tic audit remained consecutive.
- No recorded consistency violations. Neural/game clocks matched within the
  declared numerical tolerance. Reconstructing the fixed decoder from rounded
  telemetry gave maximum errors of 0.000119 turn units and 0.000397 move units;
  rate-filter reconstruction differed by at most 0.000873 Hz.
- Source and graph hashes matched the running provenance and were unchanged
  across the window. These records do not contain a complete live weight or
  membrane-state checkpoint; they cannot prove every unobserved internal value.
- Activity stayed finite: 338,074,144 additional modeled spikes, averaging
  3.22 spikes/neuron/s across the retained graph. Population averages cannot
  establish that particular biological circuits behaved correctly.

## Gameplay and progress

There were nine complete game episodes and two boundary-censored episodes. All
nine complete episodes ended at the configured 60-second limit with health 100.
They produced two kills total (seven episodes with zero and two with one); a
third kill occurred in the final incomplete episode. This provides no evidence
of improved survival: every complete episode reached the same time limit, and
recorded health did not decline. It does not establish damage avoidance.

Ammo was empty in 84.4% of snapshots. An attack command was active while ammo
was empty in 76.4% of all snapshots. The button was pressed on 93.0% of audited
tics; that is not equivalent to firing a projectile or aiming successfully.
Forward output hit its clamp on 35.1% of tics. We did not record position or
aiming ground truth, so navigation cannot be validated from these traces.

Across thirds of neural time, mean forward output was 18.832, 18.848 and 18.807;
attack fractions were 93.05%, 92.75% and 93.18%. These are descriptive values
from one continuing neural state, not independent trials or evidence of
training. The public baseline has no plasticity and reinforcement is disabled.

The earlier matched six-second controls remain relevant: intact-vision kills
were 1/1/1 versus black-input 3/3/2 and clamped-output 0/0/0. They are too small
for a benchmark but show no demonstrated performance advantage from vision.
The separate new stimulus assays also found no modeled T4/T5 or KC spikes.
Those new candidate-development findings are documented separately in
[the learning review](doom-learning-review.md).

## Delivery and performance limits

The independent curl probe succeeded on 58 of 59 minute-spaced public checks.
One connection failed at 21:17:46 UTC. Successful public samples had median
frame age 0.294 seconds and maximum 2.479 seconds. All 59 requests by the primary
Python HTTP client were rejected with HTTP 403, a distinct transport result.
Neither series proves continuous availability or a continuous outage.

The host was shared with read-only profiling, separate full-graph experiments,
unit tests and website compilation. These loads are recorded in the observation
amendments; throughput is not an isolated hardware benchmark. The original feed
was restarted only after the completed observation was saved, to set BLAS to
one thread before NumPy import. That starts a new neural/game state and is not
part of this baseline. No neural equation, graph or timestep changed.

## Scientific validity and novelty

The retained MaleCNS reconstruction is real anatomical data. Its uniform LIF
approximation, inferred retinal geometry, tonic current and selected BCI outputs
are modeling/engineering choices. Graded visual signaling and many receptor or
modulatory mechanisms are not represented faithfully. The observed behavior
cannot validate those assumptions by resemblance alone.

[Shiu et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07763-9) previously modeled
sensorimotor functions with a fly connectome. [Lappalainen et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07939-3)
showed the importance of physiological constraints and parameter inference for
visual-response prediction. [Eon's embodiment demonstration](https://eon.systems/updates/embodied-brain-emulation)
and [Cortical Labs' neuron-controlled Doom](https://corticallabs.com/doom.html)
also precede this project. See [the primary-source prior-art review](doom-qa-prior-art.md)
for distinctions and additional work. This is not an exhaustive priority search.

Our defensible contribution is an accessible full-retained-MaleCNS-to-Doom
implementation with inspectable inputs, neural output traces, provenance and
openly reported negative controls. New neuroscience would require a new testable
biological prediction and independent experimental support. Do not claim first
ever, uploaded consciousness, a living brain, natural fly vision or learned Doom
skill from this demonstration.

Suggested wording: “We connected a simulation using the retained male fruit-fly
connectome to live Doom pixels. Selected simulated neurons operate a fixed game
interface. The experiment exposes its wiring, activity and validation limits.”

The figure and exported data were generated from the completed recording. The
figure was visually inspected. The analyzer previously detected an intentionally
corrupted action record in a separate negative-control fixture.
